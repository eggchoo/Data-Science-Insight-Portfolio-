## Projects 
### Data Science & Insights Projects 
[Teamfight Tactics In-Game Strategy Analysis: Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/eggchoo/Data-Science-Insight-Portfolio-/blob/main/Teamfight%20Tactics%20combo%20clustering%20analysis/tft%20match%20analysis.ipynb) 

**KMeans clustering** was used to identify combos of traits, using Teamfight Tactics (patch 6.5) match data of the top 100 Challenger players in NA. Identified players' in-game strategy and analyzed **key metrics (average placement, pick rate, top4 rate, and win rate)** for combos, units, items, and traits. Provided insights for players' in-game strategy. 

_Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, ast, json, Matplotlib, Seaborn_

[OUTLAD User Retention, Churn, and Conversion: Survival Analysis and Regression](https://github.com/eggchoo/Data-Science-Insight-Portfolio-/blob/main/OULAD%20project/OUTLAD_user_retention%20%26%20conversion_analysis.ipynb) 

Using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OUTLAD) and developed key metrics to evaluate **user behaviour (i.e. registration, activation, retention, churn, and conversion)**. Identified **at-risk users and converter profiles**. Conducted **survival analysis** to identify key factors **predicting churn** and **logistic regression** to investigate factors contributing to **user conversion**, both with adjustment of covariates. 

_Tools: Lifelines, Statsmodels, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn_

[CookieCats Game Retention: A/B Testing](https://github.com/eggchoo/Data-Science-Insight-Portfolio-/blob/main/cookie%20cats%20game%20retention%20ab%20testing/cookie_cats_ab_test_game_retention.ipynb) 

Conducted **A/B testing** on **user retention rate** (retention after 1 day and 7 days) in response to different placement of progression gate (level-30 vs level-40). Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to compare sum of gamerounds between two groups. Two-proportion z test to compare retention rates between two groups. 

[Marketing Campaigns: Funnel Analysis and A/B testing](https://github.com/eggchoo/Data-Science-Insight-Portfolio-/blob/main/Marketing%20campaigns%20ab%20testing/marketing_campaign_ab%20testing.ipynb) 

Conducted **A/B testing** on **funnel metrics** to compare the old and new marketing campaign performance. Developed key funnel metrics inlcuding **CTR (Click Through Rate), search rate, view rate, ATC (Add to Cart) rate, purchase rate, overall conversion rate**. Established **reproducible experiment workflow** following data cleaning, experiment integrity checks, descriptive analysis and hypothesis testing. 

_Tools: Statsmodels, Scipy, Pingouin, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn_

[TelecomX Churn Analysis and Future Churn Prediction](https://github.com/eggchoo/Telecom-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction) 
Identified key factors influencing churn, highlights high-risk customer segments, and presents actionable strategies to improve retention, enhance customer satisfaction, and support long-term business growth. Created a model using Randomforest classifier to identify future churners. 

_Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn_ 

### Data Insight Projects  
[ShopEasy Marketing Insights: Conversion, Customer Engagement and Feedback](https://github.com/eggchoo/ShopEasy-marketing-analysis) 
Analyzed the marketing performance of a online retail store with key metrics including conversion, customer engagement and rating. Conducted sentiment analysis on customer feedback. 

_Tools: SQL server, Pandas, nltk_ 

[GlobalLink Logistics Performance](https://github.com/eggchoo/GlobalLink-Logistics-analysis/blob/main/README.md) 

Provided data-driven insights to improve delivery efficiency, reduce return rates, and enhance overall business performance.

_Tools: SQL server_ 

[Yelp Buiness Insights](https://github.com/eggchoo/Yelp-business-analysis) 

Analyzed large scaled Yelp data to identify key factors driving customer ratings, engagement, and business visibility. 

_Tools: Python, AWS, SNOWFLAKE (Python, MySQL)_
